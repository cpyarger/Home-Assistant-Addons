# SDR Meter Reader hass.io addon
A hass.io addon for a software defined radio tuned to listen for Utility Meter RF transmissions and republish the data via Home Assistant's API

- This hassio addon is based on  JDeath's [RTLAMR2MQTT](https://github.com/jdeath/RTLAMR2MQQT/tree/master/RTLAMR2MQQT) addon
- Which is based on biochemguy's [(non-docker) setup](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/get-your-smart-electric-water-and-gas-meter-scm-readings-into-home-assistant-with-a-rtl-sdr)
- This hass.io addon is based on James Fry' [project](https://github.com/james-fry/hassio-addons/tree/master/rtl4332mqtt)
- which was based on Chris Kacerguis' [project](https://github.com/chriskacerguis/honeywell2mqtt)
- which is in turn based on Marco Verleun's [rtl2mqtt image](https://github.com/roflmao/rtl2mqtt)

## Usage

1) Install the addon. Do this by either:
    - Downloading this repository and adding in a folder under /addons/ (eg. /addons/sdrmr)
    - Adding this respository to the Add-on Store

2) Use the addon configuration page to setup:
    - msgType (RTLAMR Message type; see below)
    - ids* (IDs of the sensors you want to watch)
    - pause_time (Time between Readings in seconds)
    - *_unit_of_measurement (The unit appended to the output)
    - *_multiplier (value read from meter is multiplied by this)

3) Start the addon

### Message Types

The following message types are supported by rtlamr:

- **scm**: Standard Consumption Message. Simple packet that reports total consumption.
- **scm+**: Similar to SCM, allows greater precision and longer meter ID's.
- **idm**: Interval Data Message. Provides differential consumption data for previous 47 intervals at 5 minutes per interval.
- **netidm**: Similar to IDM, except net meters (type 8) have different internal packet structure, number of intervals and precision. Also reports total power production.
- **r900**: Message type used by Neptune R900 transmitters, provides total consumption and leak flags.
- **r900bcd**: Some Neptune R900 meters report consumption as a binary-coded digits.
- **all**: Listen for ALL of the above message types

### Multipliers

Some meters report in units that are not compatible with the HA energy dashboard. Multipliers can be set for each meter type so that meter readings can be converted to a compatible unit of measure. Here are a few examples of usage:

- Some water meters report usage in 10ths of a gallon. To correct the reading, set water_multiplier = 0.1.
- If your meter reports in CCF (centi cubic feet), you can set the multiplier to 748.1 to conver to gallons. Then select gal for the unit of measure.

## Hardware

This has been tested and used with the following hardware (you can get it on Amazon)

- NooElec NESDR Nano 2+ Tiny Black RTL-SDR USB
- RTL-SDR Blog R820T2 RTL2832U 1PPM TCXO SMA Software Defined Radio


## Troubleshooting

If you see this error:

> Kernel driver is active, or device is claimed by second instance of librtlsdr.
> In the first case, please either detach or blacklist the kernel module
> (dvb_usb_rtl28xxu), or enable automatic detaching at compile time.

Then run the following command on the host

```bash
sudo rmmod dvb_usb_rtl28xxu rtl2832
```

## Posting a bug report, or adding more data from your meters. 
I only have a couple meters on my house, so I don't have example data to get all the sensors right, 

If you need me to make any changes please turn on debug mode in the config, and post a snippit of your logs to a github issue
